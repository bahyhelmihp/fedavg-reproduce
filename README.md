## fedavg-reproduce
This repository is intended to reproduce the original Federated Learning paper (FedAVG) launched by Google, [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf) [1]. 

**Contents**:
<br>
(1) FedAVG Algorithm
<br>
(2) IID vs Non-IID
<br>
(3) Reproducing Results in [1]

**Notes**
<br>
Results may be different from the original paper due to some different parameter settings, though, it still proves and shows the identical pattern as shown on the paper.
